<!-- ### Research
Making sense of data is possibly the biggest problem in Neuroscience and beyond. We build algorithms to analyze data. We also use theory as well as computational and [neural modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_neuroscience) to understand how information is processed in the nervous system, explaining data obtained in collaboration with [electrophysiologists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophysiology) and in [psychophysical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychophysics) experiments. Lastly, we constrain and develop new technologies aimed at obtaining data about brains.


Our conceptual work addresses information processing in the nervous system from two angles: (1) By analyzing and explaining electrophysiological data, we study what neurons do. (2) By analyzing and explaining human behavior, we study what all these neurons do together. Much of our work looks at these questions from a normative or causal viewpoint, asking what problems the nervous system should be solving. This often means taking a Bayesian approach. Bayesian decision theory is the systematic way of calculating how the nervous system may make good decisions in the presence of uncertainty. Causal inference from observational data promises to be a key enabler for progress in science.

We've pursued projects that involve handshake greetings, human movement, [cell-phone related parkinson's research](http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fneur.2012.00158/abstract), competitions at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), [meta-science analysis](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v489/n7415/full/489201a.html), data sharing initiatives, and [recording from all neurons in a mouse](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002291).
