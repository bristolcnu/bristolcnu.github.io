### Postdocs
<header class="masthead text-justify" style="font-size:120%">
We are always interested in hearing from potential postdocs - please contact individual PIs early and we can work on figuring out funding.
Note that the University of Bristol has been particularly successful in getting <a href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/red/development/international/mariecurie/mariecuriefellows/" target="_blank">Marie Curie Fellowships</a>.</header>

### PhD students

<header class="masthead text-justify" style="font-size:120%">

<b>Neural Dynamics Wellcome Trust doctoral program</b><br>
The <a href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/neural-dynamics/" target="_blank">Neural Dynamics PhD</a> is a unique program that provides world-class training at the intersection between computational and experimental neuroscience.<br><br>

<b>EPSRC Centres for Doctoral Training</b><br>
Bristol has a wide range of CDTs that align with our research (e.g. <a href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/cdt/digital-health/" target="_blank">Digital Health</a>, <a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/cdt/interactive-ai/" target="_blank">Interactive AI</a>, <a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/cdt/compass/" target="_blank">Computational Statistics and Data Science</a> and <a href="https://www.farscope.bris.ac.uk" target="_blank">Robotics and Autonomous Systems</a>). You can find a detailed list <a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/doctoral-college/doctoral-training-centres/" target="_blank">here</a>. Contact individual PIs if you are interested in these programs.<br><br>

<b>More info</b><br>
UK PhDs take 3-4 years and usually start in September (although this is flexible). If you would like to do a PhD in our unit, we have a range of projects available. Many projects involve collaborations with experimentalists either here in Bristol, or Europe or US. Please contact us to discuss funding options, which vary a lot depending on your country of origin. Usually you would need a good Bachelors or Masters degree in computer science, biology, physics, engineering or maths before taking on a computational neuroscience PhD - but other backgrounds are possible. However, the most important thing is not your background, but that you enjoy research work, are curious, and want to understand how the brain works.</header>

#### Master students
<header class="masthead text-justify" style="font-size:120%">
If you are a student on the University of Bristol Conversion or Advanced MSc in Computer Science, please check the project system on SAFE for available projects. Projects can vary in their 1) level of computational/mathematical difficulty, 2) level of biological detail, and 3) whether they are more focused on computational modelling (simulating the brain) versus statistical data analysis/machine learning. We can work out the details of the project to match your skills and interests.</header>

#### Undergrad students
<header class="masthead text-justify" style="font-size:120%">
If you are a student on the University of Bristol BSc or MEng degree in Computer Science (or a related degree), please contact us early in the academic year to discuss possible computational neuroscience projects. Projects can vary in their 1) level of computational/mathematical difficulty, 2) level of biological detail, and 3) whether they are more focused on computational modelling (simulating the brain) versus statistical data analysis/machine learning. It also would be good, but not essential, if you take or have taken one of our teaching units (<i>Computational Neuroscience</i> and <i>Information Processing and the Brain</i>) jointly taught by Cian O'Donell, Conor Houghton and Rui Ponte Costa.</header>
