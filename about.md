### About us
Computational neuroscientists apply computational and mathematical approaches to the study of the brain and, in the other direction, seek to uncover insights into computation and mathematics by working with experimental neuroscientists in trying to understanding how the brain works.â€‹

We are interested in the algorithmic structure of the central nervous system and the neurobiological systems and mechanisms that support them.

### History

Computational Neuroscience at the University of Bristol has a long tradition.
