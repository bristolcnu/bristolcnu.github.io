Currrently, I am interested in language comprehension. I use human brain recording techniques (EEG) and computational methods to understand how humans process language. My recent work investigates the relative contributions of syntax and semantics during sentence comprehension and I have a particular interest in the role of hierarchical syntactic structure. I aim to understand whether the brain relies on knowledge of learned grammatical rules to generate meaning, or whether statistical processing at the word-level is more important. Future work will address how language processing of a second language learnt in adulthood differs to that of the native language.
