My background is here in Bristol where I completed my undergraduate MEng degree in Computer Science. Throughout my undergraduate studies I developed an interest in Bayesian statistics and probabilistic modelling of the brain, this naturally led to my final year project under Cianâ€™s supervision on investigating spatial decoding methods for electrophysiological recordings.
<br><br>
My PhD research looks at developing Bayesian models for large multi-region recordings from the brain, placing an emphasis on modelling connectivity and hierarchical structure.
