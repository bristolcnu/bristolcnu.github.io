After my BSc in Mathematics I enrolled in the Robotics MSc at Bristol University, where I completed a research project in conjunction with Bristol Robotics Laboratory and Ultraleap. The project attempted to ascertain to what extent a TacTip tactile probe could tell us how humans should feel when they touch virtual objects generated by the Ultraleap device. After my Masters I spent a year in industry, where I led the development of NLP algorithms for use in diagnostic chatbot systems.

I'm interested in using technology to enhance human cognitive function. My current research examines how to use intracranial EEG data to perform real time memory replay detection and classification in the hippocampus; the goal is to aid understanding of the purpose of memory replay during sleep.
