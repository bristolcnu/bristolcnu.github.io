After a degree in Physics at Imperial College London and a stint in the engineering industry, my PhD focuses on how memory is consolidated during sleep. I am currently working on the development of a behavioural paradigm and computational methods, to effectively analyse human intra-cranial sleep data. I will be using variation in recollection accuracy to infer the influence of electrophysiological features recorded during replay events from the hippocampus and neocortex.
