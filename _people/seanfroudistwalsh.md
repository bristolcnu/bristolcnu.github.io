Neuroscience is undergoing a revolution in the quality and quantity of available data. Our challenge is to turn this exquisite new data into a more complete understanding of how the brain works, and to translate that knowledge into meaningful change for patients with brain disorders.

I apply tools from mathematics and neuroscience to study how memories are stored across the brain, and how this process breaks down in people with memory problems (like some patients with psychiatric disorders or brain damage).

I develop mathematical models of how higher cognitive functions such as short and long-term memories emerge from the interactions between cells across the brain. I collaborate with anatomists, physiologists and psychiatrists in order make our models accurately reflect the cutting edge of neuroscience knowledge while staying relevant and useful for clinicians.
