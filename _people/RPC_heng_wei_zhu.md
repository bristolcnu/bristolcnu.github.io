I completed my undergraduate degree in Neuroscience at the University of Bristol and am currently a student on the Wellcome Trust Neural Dynamics PhD programme. I am interested in how biologically inspired deep learning models learn and the predictions they make to guide experimental neuroscience in understanding the brain. I am working on the effect of cholinergic neuromodulation on cortical microcircuits in learning and memory. I have been implementing biologically plausible models of backpropagation to explore a role for the cholinergic system in credit assignment and will be testing these predictions using in vitro brain slice electrophysiology.
