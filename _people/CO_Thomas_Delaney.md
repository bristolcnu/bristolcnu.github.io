I do research on the behaviour and modelling of large ensembles of neurons. My background is in mathematics (B.A. Trinity College Dublin) and informatics (MSc University of Edinburgh). I have experience in back-end software engineering for financial and high-frequency trading, and I have worked as a commercial data scientist. I am currently working on finding networks of neurons using pairwise measurements such as correlations or mutual information, and detecting communities within those networks using the  cutting edge community detection methods.
