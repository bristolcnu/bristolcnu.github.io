Anne did her PhD with the Neural and Machine Learning group and it now a postdoc with the same group. Anne is interested in building computational models of metacognition and metacognitive bias in the context of different psychopathologies, in particular depression. In her current project, she explores the association between self-performance beliefs and performance, the nature of learning about own ability and deviations of both, perception of and learning about own performance in the context of depression. 

<br><br>
To study this, Anne combines online behavioural studies with different computational models including Bayesian, reinforcement learning and multi-level neural network models and combinations thereof.

<br><br>
Outside of academia, Anne enjoys getting lost in books, painting(s) and the forest, preferably on a bicycle.
