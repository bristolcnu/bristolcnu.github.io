Prior to starting my PhD in Bristol, I studied Neuroscience at The University of Edinburgh (BSc Biomedical Sciences (Neuroscience)). In my PhD, I am currently using Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM) of task-based EEG data to examine how the connectivity of behavioural memory circuits are compromised in patients with Alzheimer's disease, and how this may differ from both healthy controls and patients with other types of dementia. I am using two different DCMs, one to test the slow amplitude envelope of signal transmission through the network, and the other for phase-amplitude coupling to each individuals' recordings. I will expand on this in a future study by using task-based fMRI to investigate the role of noradrenaline in optimal decision making and working memory, also employing DCM computational techniques. In this study I will examine state prediction error and reward prediction error as part of an Active Inference model.
