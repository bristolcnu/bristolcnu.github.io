David studied math and computer science at MIT. He did his PhD with the Neural & machine learning group [and Tim Vogels (Oxford)], and is now a visiting Research Associate with us. David works on understanding the intricate roles of synaptic plasticity for signal processing in cortical circuits through computational modelling of spiking networks, and is now exploring deep learning.
