I studied Electronics and Computer Science (MEng) at the University of Edinburgh where I focused on machine learning, robotics and autonomous systems as well as parallel architectures and software in the embedded systems relevant for the Internet of Things.

My research lies at the intersections of deep reinforcement learning, robotics, and neuroscience. I am interested in exploiting neuroscientific ideas and sim-to-real approaches to perform manipulation tasks by utilising simulation to speed up training time of the physical robot. On top of that, I am interested in exploring curiosity-driven learning to train robots through self-supervision.
