I completed my undergraduate degree in Medical Sciences at the University of Leeds, during which I spent a year working in an immunology research lab at a pharmaceutical company. Following this I studied for a Masters in Neuroscience at the University of Edinburgh where my research project focused on analysing place cell dynamics.  My PhD project will investigate the cholinergic modulation of synaptic transmission and plasticity within hippocampal region CA3 and how this could be important for memory encoding. To address this I use in vitro brain slice electrophysiology techniques and single neuron multicompartmental modelling.
