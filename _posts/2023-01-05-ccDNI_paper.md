The Neural and Machine Learning group has just published a new [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-35658-8) in Nature Communications on a deep learning model of cerebro-cerebellar networks for both motor and cognitive tasks, which captures a number of observations while making several experimental predictions.
